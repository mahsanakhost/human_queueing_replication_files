The following files are core (the fist two being the most important):

E_V_TH_fatigue_2           (main CTMC model)
MarkovSolve2               (solve balance equations)
SIM                        (optimization algotrithm)
WLA                        (optimization algotrithm)
BA                         (optimization algotrithm)

The following files are making the numerical experiment runs:

Analysis
Analysis_Large             (varies line lenght)
NumStudyAlg_Behavior       (varies behavioral parameters)
NumStudyAlg_System         (varies system paramaters, e.g. buffer space, erlang phase)


Folder Draw:Convex
Used for the conjecture of convexity

Folder Comparison_Delta
Used to run simple benchmarks to be able to calculate the Delta's reported
